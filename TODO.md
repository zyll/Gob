- stack and sticky ordering
- implement update (do the U of crud and use POST and PUT as in rest (using _put in form and middleware)).
- removing a stack should remove its stickies too. Same is true for Board and Stack.
- implement deploy ability.
- implement user ability.
- provide a service to be aware about any change on any type of object (using socket.io for browser agent, or any other kind of notif as email or a human or url callback for a server).
- do tpl
- backbonise
- event feedback
- config file (server port, db conf ...)
- backlog.
- test that model return null on not found
- test .all method on Stack and Board.
